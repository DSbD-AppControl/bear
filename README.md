# BEAR

This is the home for the  **BEAR** (Behavioral Enforcement & Attestation Runtime) project.

## Mission 

> Our mission is to develop the Behavioural Enforcement and
> Attestation Runtime aimed at securing open-source software by enabling
> security automation throughout the software development lifecycle. This framework will
> leverage formal specification languages, static analysis techniques, and
> runtime monitoring and enforcement to ensure robust security postures. By 
> integrating these components, the framework will provide a comprehensive solution
> for specifying, verifying, and enforcing the expected behaviour of software
> applications, thereby reducing the risk of vulnerabilities and attacks.

BEAR aspires to become a sandbox project at the [Open Source Security Foundation (OpenSSF)]
as part of the [Supply Chain Integrity Working Group].

## Current Status

BEAR is in pre-alpha. We are currently working on defining an appropriate [specification language](./docs/specification-language.md) in line with our [technical vision](./docs/technical-vision.md).

We are actively looking for contributors and seeking feedback from potential users.
